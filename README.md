## Shut it down!

Facebook sucks up so much time. I haven't been on in years and only use messenger. I recently logged in because I needed RSVP to a relative's wedding, and noticed how easy it is to get sucked back in. I prefer to stay away from facebook, this userscript does just that.

## "Installing"

#### First: Enable Browser Support
Your browser needs to be capable of running UserScripts (pretty much all modern browsers). Google your browser and "userscript extension" or you can just [look here](https://greasyfork.org/en). (On chrome I prefer the [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag?hl=en) extension, but they all work the same so it doesn't matter.)

#### Second: Install the Script
Once you have an extension that can handle `.user.js` files, you can install the self-updating script file [directly from GitHub](https://github.com/paul-nelson-baker/javascript-nuke-facebook/raw/master/nuke-facebook.user.js).
